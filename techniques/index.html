    <h3 id="goldlist">Gold List &ldquo;Method/Methodology&rdquo; or Goldlist Method</h3>
    <p>The &ldquo;gold list method&rdquo; is a vocabulary learning technique (not a method)
      invented by <a href="http://huliganov.tv/goldlist-eu/">Viktor D. Huliganov</a> / David J. James / Uncle Davey.
      The technique is based on the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve">forgetting curve</a> that
      <span lang="de">Hermann Ebbinghaus</span> discovered in the late 19th century.
      Its goal is long-term memory acquisition.

        you learn most when you are &ldquo;negotiating meaning&rdquo; but native speakers are not interested in that;
        native speakers find it very hard to adapt their level to the learner they are speaking with.
        Speaking with other learners is more helpful, among other reasons because the level will be right for you.

    <p>The <abbr>FORCE</abbr> cycle is a system to improve your speaking and listening skills in a foreign language. 
      The method relies on speaking in your target language and preparing for this 
      by anticipating certain things (vocabulary and grammar) that may come up in the conversation.
      The idea is that you work through a specific cycle while talking to native speakers of your target language.
      Each <abbr>FORCE</abbr> cycle should bring you closer to your long-term objectives in your target language.
      <abbr>FORCE</abbr> stands for Focus, Organise, Rehearse, Communicate, Evaluate.
    </p>
    <p>The first phase, <strong>focus</strong>, is about things that you will need soon and often. 
      These things should be part of your life and that you would also talk about in your native language,
      <abbr>e.g.</abbr> your family, your language learning, your work, your home country, your native language. 
      There are two types of focus: a topic or theme to talk about, and a skill (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> how to order coffee, how to receive or accept an invitation).
      The focus should be specific; you should to yourself something like, &ldquo;I am going to learn how to buy a hard drive for my computer in Spanish.&rdquo;
      By limiting the focus, you make the preparation of the conversation more manageable.
      <!-- Which parts of the cycle makes sure that you have received enough "comprehensible input" before you move on to the output phase? -->
    </p>
    <p>The second phase, <strong>organise</strong>, is about collecting vocabulary, phrases and language patterns
      that you will use to talk about the topic that you selected from your focus. 
      Memorising the vocabulary and grammar patterns is not sufficient to become bilingual, 
      you also need to use them. You can collect the vocabulary and phrases from all kinds of sources:
      textbooks, phrase books, advertisements, Wikipedia articles, conversations you overhear, films, etcetera.
      Swayne recommends writing these things down by hand instead of using a smart phone or a computer.
      When you ask native speakers how do say certain things, you need to be careful about how you phrase your question.
      Don't ask for translations of sentences in your native languages, but ask questions like,
      &ldquo;Tell me how you would shop for a smart phone in Spanish.&rdquo;
      This will give much more authentic input. (A good dictionary will also provide sample phrases that you can use.)
      The amount of material you organise depends on the level of proficiency you have:
      at the beginner level, you should limit the materials to a single page;
      you can increase this as your proficiency increases.
    </p>
    <p>The third phase, <strong>rehearse</strong>, is about rehearsing the materials
      you collected during the &ldquo;organise&rdquo; phase until you know that you can use them in conversation.
      You should not take on too much; the goal is to say much but to say it well.
      Make sure that you can pronounce the words and phrases well. You should say them out loud.
      Swayne recommends learning the 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">International Phonetic Alphabet</a>, 
      which is used in many dictionaries. He also recommends
      <a href="http://forvo.com/">Forvo</a>, a site where you can find the pronunciation of words in many languages.
      If you have recordings, learn to imitate them as closely as you can. 
      If you are confronted with long words or phrases, it is more efficient to 
      start with the last syllable (or word) and gradually add the parts in front of it;
      this is more efficient than moving from the first syllable (or word) to the last.
    </p>
    <p>The fourth phase, <strong>communicate</strong>, is about the actual conversations.
      Conversations are the most natural way of learning languages. 
      Using a foreign language by communicating with people who know the language better than you will ensure steady progress.
      The goal of the conversation is not to dominate it but to keep it going so you get a lot of input in your target language.
      You should also be prepared for comments about how well (or badly) you speak the language.
      You need to be prepared for this, for example, by learning the culturally appropriate way to respond to compliments.
      (For example, in Chinese and Japanese, you are supposed to be humble or modest about your skills.)
      The conversations need not be too long, to avoid that you get tired or lose track. 
      Swayne recommends 15 minutes or less at the beginning, and that you gradually build up to longer conversations later on.
      You will also need to get good at 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumlocution">circumlocution</a>:
      if you don't know a certain word, try to describe the concept instead of relying on translations.
      Sometimes you will have to guess the meaning of words or phrases based on context, body language and other clues.
      <!-- 19:00 compliments can also be a good way to make people more willing to talk in your target language,
        e.g. "Oh, your English is really good. I wish I could speak Spanish at that level. Do you mind if we speak Spanish for a few minutes?"
        You will also need to accept that you will sometimes be unable to finish a sentence that you started.
      -->
      It is also useful to learn to say, &ldquo;I don't know yet how to say that in your language.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>In the last phase, <strong>evaluate</strong>, you take notes on a few specific questions.
      Swayne recommends that you do this using pen and paper instead of in your head.
      The questions are the following: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Was your focus specific enough or broad enough? How could it have been better?</li>
      <li>Was your speaking partner appropriate and was the location of the conversation suitable?</li>
      <li>Was the conversation too long or too short? If you felt exhausted afterwards, it was too long.</li>
      <li>Were the words and phrases you prepared for your cycle appropriate and sufficient?  
        <br />Are there any learning resources that would help you prepare your organisation phase much better? (For example, books with vocabulary organised by theme.)
      </li>
      <li>Were you understood completely, partly or just a little bit? What were the difficulties (on either side)?
        Did you rehearse enough? Did you anticipate the responses of the other person?
      </li>
      <li>Did you understand what was said to you? How much did you understand? Did you have to guess a lot?
        Was your vocabulary adequate?
      </li>
      <li>Were you confused by unfamiliar language patterns?</li>
      <li>Did you have difficulty understanding words or sounds?</li>
      <li>Was your <abbr>FORCE</abbr> cycle suitable for your proficiency level?</li>
      <li>Did you exchange real information without using your native language (or another language that you know better)?</li>
      <li>Did you handle misunderstandings effectively? 
        (Strategies include clarification, repetition, confirmation, paraphrasing and guessing. You should use these strategies before falling back to your native language or another bridge language.)
      </li>
      <li>Could your speaking partner offer any helpful feedback on how to communicate better?</li>
      <li>Can you fix your earlier mistakes in your next cycle?</li>
      <li>Were you courteous, friendly and culturally appropriate in your conversation?
        (For example, many languages have formal and informal forms of address, and these need to be used appropriately.)
      </li>
      <li>Did you notice any new words, phrases or language patterns that you need to master?
        If yes, write them down so you can add them to a future cycle. 
        (This is why the evaluation phase needs to be done immediately after the communication phase.)
      </li>
      <li>What would have been helpful to you that you didn't know when you went into the communication phase?</li>
      <li>What should be the focus of the next cycle? (This should be something that interests you.)</li>
      <li>Did you learn anything new about the target language culture?</li>
      <li>Evaluate your pronunciation, especially in the first six months of your study.
        Ask people to comment on your pronunciation. 
        For example, ask whether your pronunciation is difficult to understand, fairly easy to understand most of the time, not a problem, or very good.
        If people talk to you without pausing or adjusting your language to you, that is probably a good sign.
      </li>
      <li>Evaluate the level of understanding in both directions.
        Write down your successes, not just your mistakes.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Language Deconstruction</h3>
    <p>Language deconstruction is
      a technique by Tim Ferris that helps you find out what a language is
      like <em>before</em> you start learning it.

        (<i class="ytchannel">Julian Northbrook</i> on YouTube, 11 minutes, 29.08.2013).
        This video introduces the technique, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> how it works and its benefits.
        Julian advises using audio content that is at or just a bit above your current level.
        For the first demonstration, he uses a text that he has read several times to make sure that he understands it completely.
        For the second demonstration, he shadows the audio without using the text.
        You should use the same audio content for a whole week, or until you feel that you &ldquo;become&rdquo; the speaker in the audio.
        (Using a transcript of the audio is something that other language learners or teachers don't mention or recommend.
        Also, other people use headphones, but that does not work well for a demo.)

        <i class="blog">VirtuallyNATIVE</i>, 03.01.2017.
        Vladimir Skenderoff comes from Bulgaria, started learning English at the age of 27 and is author of the Kindle book
        <i class="booktitle">Virtually Native: Learn How To Learn English - by a non-native, for the non-native</i> (August 2016).
        He argues that it is better to repeat the words right after the speaker in the video, so you can hear your own voice better.
        This requires that you pause the video (or audio) when you repeat the words.
        The example he uses is the scene <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jly4dXapR9c">Good times, noodle salad</a>
        from the film <i>As Good as It Gets</i>.

        Vladimir found out that shadowing is a technique that is mainly recommended for interpreter trainees,
        <abbr>i.e.</abbr> for very advanced learners, and that it is mainly for listening practice.
        In order to improve your pronunciation and intonation, you need to hear your own voice.
        Vladimir also adds that, <q>You cannot internalise native stress-timing nor speed</q>;
        you will speak your target language at the same speed as your native language.
        However, shadowing is much better than doing nothing. If you like doing it, you can continue doing it,
        but repeat after the native speaker.

        The video responds to a message by someone who makes the same point as Vladimir Skenderoff (see above).
        Repeating is a slow process.<!--@@summary of first part-->

        (<i class="ytchannel">Luca Lampariello</i> on YouTube, 9 minutes, 31.10.2018).
        <br />According to Luca, language learners who achieve a native-like pronunciation share three things:
        interest, method and attitude. His tips are the following:
        <ol type="1">
          <li>You should tackle phonetics from the very beginning.
          People who acquire a good accent, take interest in correct pronunciation from the very beginning.</li>
          <li>You should start with intonation first. This is also how children learn speech.
          <!--https://youtu.be/Z9g_Fpazv2Q?t=124 Claims that young children also focus on the sentence level first before they figure out the details.--></li>
          <li>Find materials that you can read while listening to it and pay attention to the pronunciation.</li>
          <li>While listening to the spoken version of a printed text, use a pencil to mark where the intonation goes up or down.</li>
          <li>Practise pronuncation by reading out loud texts that you have listened to.
            Do not simple follow along with the audio; you need to deeply understand the meaning and the sound and how they related.
            (Luca <a href="https://youtu.be/Z9g_Fpazv2Q?t=317">demonstrates how slowly you should try to read</a>.)
          </li>
          <li>Interleave your learning activities to provide variety.</li>
          <li>Get feedback. You can record your voice to listen to your pronunciation, but you can also send it to a native speaker.</li>
        </ol>
        <!--CS comment:
          I work on pronunciation, mainly with a combination of articulation exercises, shadowing and reading aloud. Especially if you live in the country where your target language is spoken, a strong accent can work against you because people may take you less seriously.
          I strongly agree with the point about getting the pronunciation right from the start. In German language schools for adults, I encounter people who have been learning Chinese or Spanish for years and still make pronunciation errors that should have been corrected at an early stage. Examples are using the schwa at the end of Spanish word that end on 'e' and using the uvular R at the end of Spanish words that end on 'r'. (I am referring to people in a B1 course!)
          I have also encountered Germans who don't know the difference in pronunciation between the vowels in (pinyin) zhi and zhe or between the vowels in shi and xi in Standard Chinese after learning Chinese for several years.
          Note that the Council of Europe changed the CEFR descriptors early this year: all references to "native speaker(s)" were replaced by "other speaker(s) of the language". This also applies to pronunciation. In other words, for the CEFR, understandability is more important than sounding like a native.

    <p>The <strong>mimic method</strong> is a way to improve your pronunciation in a foreign language.

      (English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Mandarin and German).
      (Idahosa Ness also created an online course on

    <h3>Various Vocabulary Learning Techniques</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fwUxh2jfTo">Use a Notebook to Learn More English Vocabulary - Increase English Vocabulary</a>
        (Oxford Online English, 17 minutes, 07.03.2017).
        <br />Although this video is about English vocabulary, the tips it provides apply to other languages as well.
        The video recommends using a notebook that is small enough so you can carry it in your pocket.
        It describes four steps to recording new vocabulary:
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Recording the word clearly and correctly. Look up the word in a dictionary to make sure you get the spelling right.</li>
          <li><!--ca 3:20-->Record the meaning, for example using a translation into your own language or (better) using a definition in the target language.
            You don't need to copy out all the meanings listed in the dictionary. Drawing a picture can also help.
            It is also a good idea to add a word with the opposite meaning and a symbol indicating whether the word has a positive or a negative meaning.
          </li>
          <li><!--6:15-->Recording the &ldquo;form&rdquo; of the word, possibly in brackets next to the world.
            You can use abbreviations such as the following:
            <abbr>n</abbr> (noun), <abbr>c</abbr> (countable), <abbr>u</abbr> (uncountable), <abbr>c/u</abbr> (countable or uncountable), <abbr>adj</abbr> (adjective),
            <abbr>adv</abbr> (adverb), <abbr>v</abbr> (verb), <abbr>ID</abbr> (idiom) and <abbr>mwv</abbr> (multi-word verb).
          </li>
          <li><!--8:34-->Recording the pronunciation of the word, including stress.</li>
        </ol>
        <!--11:00-->It can also be helpful to use colours, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> different colours for different parts of speech.
        <br /><!--12:07-->The last part of the video explains how to review vocabulary.
        The first review should be done soon after the vocabulary has been recorded, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> ten minutes later.
        First read the vocabulary, then test yourself by covering the meanings. You can also do this in the opposite direction.
        <!--14:50-->Later, you can also add additional information to the words, such as collocations, and sentences using the words.

        This video recommends the use of mental images to connect foreign words with their meanings, and speaking the words out loud while you create these images.
        This works well for languages with a familiar alphabet (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> the Latin alphabet if your native is English).

        This video recommends journaling in the language you are learning. This allows you to review what you have learnt
        and gives a low-stress context for language production.
        You should journal about things and activities in your daily life using grammar and vocabulary your are currently learning.
        You should also work through and correct your journal with a native speaker.<!--tandem-->
        You should also record them reading out loud your journal content; this will give you a growing corpus of audio recordings that you can listen to for review.

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8__GkgqcKoo">Accelerate Language Learning Speed with 2 GREAT Techniques</a> 
        (4 minutes, YouTube).
        This video explains two techniques to speed up vocabulary acquisition:
        learning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate">cognates</a> first
        and using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_lists_by_frequency">frequency lists</a>.
        Cognates are words in your native language and you target language that have the same origin,
        for example, the English word &ldquo;grammar&rdquo; and the French word &ldquo;<span lang="fr">grammaire</span>&rdquo;.
        Learning cognate won't help you much when you learn an unrelated language family. 
        Using frequency lists is also recommended by

              <li>Never read without a pen in your hand (as recommended by Benjamin Franklin), so you can mark things, etcetera.</li>
              <li>Read an entire paragraph or section before you start highlighting important content.</li>
              <li>Try reading out loud to forece yourself to read more slowly.</li>
              <li>Don't always read aloud; read silently and mark sections you want to come back to later.</li>
              <li>After reading a section, explain what you've just said to yourself.</li>
              <li>Learn to x-ray a book by reviewing its table of contents and only reading the sections that will be of use to you.</li>
              <li>Pay attention to summary words such as &ldquo;therefore&rdquo;, &ldquo;as a result&rdquo; and &ldquo;in conclusion&rdquo;.</li>
              <li>Circle or underline words that you don't know to expand your vocabulary.</li>
              <li>Mark words you don't know and look them up.</li>

    <p>Language learning strategies refers to 
      <q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Language_learning_strategies&amp;oldid=664716652">the
      processes and actions that are consciously deployed by language learners to help them to learn or use a language more effectively</q>

      <br />
      <q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second-language_acquisition&amp;oldid=679211890#Strategies">Strategies
      are commonly divided into learning strategies and communicative strategies, although there are other ways of categorizing them.
      <strong>Learning strategies</strong> are techniques used to improve learning,
      such as mnemonics or using a dictionary.
      <strong>Communicative strategies</strong> are strategies a learner uses
      to convey meaning even when she doesn't have access to the correct form,
      such as using pro-forms like <i>thing</i>, or using non-verbal means such as gestures.</q>

    <h3>Listening Skills</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Kaufmann, Steve:
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88mpNyhDGAU">My Top 7 Tips For Improving Your Listening Skills</a>
        (YouTube, 9 minutes, 07.12.2017). Steve Kaufmann's top tips are the following.
        First, you need to listen to things that you have a chance of understanding; in the beginning, access to a transcript can be helpful.
        Second, in the initial stages, you should listen a lot to repetitious materials. (Repetitious here means that vocabulary and grammar are repeated a lot.) Steve listens to basic materials 50 or more times.
        Third, you should listen as soons as possible to interesting materials. Otherwise, after a while, you ability to take in new things will diminish (compared to familiar materials).
        Fourth, you should read a lot; not only things you are listening to. Reading helps you undestand when you listen.
        Fifth, vary the things that you listen to; variety is good for the brain. Once you are familiar with a certain theme, move on to something new.
        Sixth, keep listening instead of giving up when you don't understand something.
        Seventh, keep reading.

        (<i class="ytchannel"> Luca Lampariello</i> on YouTube, 7 minutes, 24.01.2019).
        <br />Instead of studying grammar rules, you should try to acquire grammar in a brain-friendly way.
        You should learn grammar from language instead of the other way around. This requires compelling content.
        Grammar notes that explain obscure points can be useful, but the key is understanding the meaning.
        You can also extract patterns from the compelling content, for example in order to compare the patterns of your target language with those in your native language.

        A user named Longinus advises against further investing into the language, arguing that this would be an example of the

          (1) you will need good time management skills (more details in next tips);
          (2) focus on one language at a time for a few days at a time rather than switching between them during the day;
          (3) use a diary to allocate times of the day and week to each of the foreign languages you are learning;
          (4) mixing up a few words here and there is not such a bad thing since it is normally not permanent;
          (5) before you start, ask yourself whether you will still have the same motivation six months, one year or a few years from now

          (2) schedule time for language study before you schedule anything else; study first thing in the morning and right before going to bed;
          (3) harness &ldquo;hidden moments&rdquo; throughout the day; for example, you can listen to podcasts while doing household chores, or
            review flashcards while queuing in a shop;
          (4) make language learning a robust habit so the decision whether or not to study does not deplete your willpower;
          (5) set social and financial stakes.

          (YouTube, 8 minutes, 11.09.2016). This video recommends the following order:
          Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian and Romanian. He suggests learning Portuguese first
          because it is the most difficult in the group and has a lot of voculary in common with the other languages.
          You should reach at least level A2 before proceeding to the next language.
          If you manage not to mix up Portuguese and Spanish, you will be in a good position to move on to the other languages.

        <q>Audiovisual material enhanced with captions or interlingual subtitles is a particularly powerful pedagogical tool which can help improve the listening comprehension skills of second-language learners.
          Captioning facilitates language learning by helping students visualize what they hear, especially if the input is not too far beyond their linguistic ability.
          Subtitling can also increase language comprehension and leads to additional cognitive benefits, such as greater depth of processing.

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD2-_GGIz7Q">Polyglots: How and Why They Can Learn So Many Languages</a>
        (<i class="ytchannel">Fluent Japanese From Anime</i> on YouTube, 14 minutes, 17.11.2017).
        This video is based on videos and other information by polyglots such as Alexander Argüelles,
        Gabriel Wyne, Benny Lewis and Steve Kaufmann.
        Benny Lewis learned ten languages by communicating with native speakers (&ldquo;speak from day one&rdquo;).
        The polyglots in the video are all autodidacts.
        With regards to methods, he mentions or cites the following points:
        <ul>
          <li><q>The number one principle in language learning is to enjoy it.</q> (Steve Kaufmann)</li>
          <li><strong>Input</strong>: anything that gets you to read or listen to your target language,
            including course books, Assimil courses and Linguaphone courses.
            When practising <strong>intensive reading</strong>, use texts that are interesting and short;
            do this when you have the most mental energy and for 30-35 minutes (maximum) at a time (Luca Lampariello).
            <strong>Extensive reading</strong> can be done for longer periods of time; content needs
            to be interesting and at your reading level (98%, according to Argüelles).
            You can start with graded readers.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Output</strong>: find native speakers and talk to them. You can find people online.
            When you should talking to native speakers is a matter of debate. Social learners may
            benefit from Lewis' &ldquo;speak from day one&rdquo; rule.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Spaced repetition systems</strong>: for example with Duolingo, Memrise, Anki or the Goldlist method.
            (You can even practise shadowing using Anki.)
            The Goldlist method was developed by David James; Luca Lampariello swears by it.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Immersion</strong>: this can be done in a country where your target language is spoken or
            by immersing your home environment into the target language.
